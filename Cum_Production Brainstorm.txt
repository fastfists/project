Qi is a known value = Sum of Oil 1 through 12
Qec ???? - rate at which things are profitable 
D ??? - Decline rate fraction - Prob from Oil 1thru12

Qt = e^[-D(1/D)ln(Qi/Qec)]
Qt = e^[-ln(Qi/Qec)]
Qt = Qec/Qi - Simplified version of Rate of Initial Prod

(Qi/D)ln(Qi^2/Qec)

//This is with a *$*1 = $40 
Assuming *$*1/barrel 
Economic Limit is $2.5k
